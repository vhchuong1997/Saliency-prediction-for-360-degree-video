# How to prepare Dataset
The Dataset we used is taken from paper *Saliency Detection in 360° Videos* by **Ziheng Zhang, Yanyu Xu**, Jingyi Yu and Shenghua Gao.
The original download link is in [[Baidu Pan]](https://pan.baidu.com/share/init?surl=akj0-8obIwC9oykTYSUm9Q) the passcode is *ry6u*.
However, since you need to install Baidu NetDisk to download the folder and Baidu requires premium account for full speed downloading, it takes a lot of time to download the Dataset.
I have reuploaded it in [[Onedrive]](https://thcsxuanduong-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/hoangchuong_thcsxuanduong_onmicrosoft_com/Eu87CfMhvHlLrGXV9B8mTmwBpgxkz-qNTNMFZFTl7t5JmQ?e=lKZfuX), password: **Saliency2018** for more convenient access.
There are 12 zip files, and train/test index. After downloading these zips, unzip them together. Then, put the unzipped folders and the file 'vinfo.pkl' into this folder named '360_Saliency_dataset_2018ECCV'
